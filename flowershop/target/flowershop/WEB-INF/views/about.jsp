      <p>An idea is like a seed but when it gets planted, it becomes a vision...such is a story of my flower shop. Starting its journey as a tiny little bud in 1992, my flower shop was born. Today, it is the world's largest floral chain, striving to become a name synonymous with flowers. With its creative and unique ideas, "Alfred's Flower Shop" endeavours to make every occasion special and memorable for its customers. Think flowers, Think "Alfred's Flower Shop"!</p>
