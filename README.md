# E-Commerce web app for a Flower shop
The project entitled ‘Flowershop’ is an E-Commerce website where the user can purchase products online. The user can create his account by registering himself with a unique username and password and then log into the portal site to browse products and purchase them. Since, modern door-to-door business and manual methods by purchasing products in markets at certain outlets seem to have a drawback, the online method of purchasing products are coming into effect and are much affordable.

The programming language used is Java, alongside H2 Database, Spring and Hibernate frameworks at it's backend. The frontend makes use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AngularJs. The project is thus combined in a build tool called Maven alongside JUnit, all together in a nutshell.
